Recipe Contest Page - Development Guide

Objective:

This guide outlines the development of a Recipes Page for an online recipe contest application. The primary goal is to create a responsive and visually appealing page that closely replicates a provided UI design. Key functionalities include efficient search, sorting, and filtering capabilities, allowing users to easily find and organize recipes based on various criteria. The objective is to gain practical experience in frontend development using React.js, component-based architecture, and efficient data manipulation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

I. Project Setup and Initialization:

Create Project Directory: Begin by creating a dedicated directory for your project using your operating system's file manager or command line. Choose a descriptive name like "recipe-contest-page".

Initialize React Project: Navigate into the newly created directory using the command line (e.g., cd recipe-contest-page). Use Create React App (CRA) to initialize a new React project: npx create-react-app . (The . tells CRA to create the project in the current directory). If you prefer TypeScript, use: npx create-react-app . --template typescript.

Install Dependencies: After the React project is set up, install the necessary dependencies. This includes any CSS framework you plan to use (Tailwind CSS is a suggested option). If choosing Tailwind CSS: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer. Then, initialize Tailwind configuration: npx tailwindcss init -p. For standard CSS modules, no additional installations are required.

Configure Tailwind CSS (If Applicable): If you're using Tailwind CSS, configure it by adding the following lines to your tailwind.config.js file:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Configure index.css (If Applicable): Add the Tailwind directives to your src/index.css file:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Clean Up Boilerplate: Remove any unnecessary files and code generated by Create React App from the src directory (e.g., logo.svg, App.css, etc.) to start with a clean slate.

II. Development Process:

Component Structure Design: Plan the component structure for your application. Based on the requirements, consider creating components like:

RecipeCard: Displays individual recipe information.
FilterSidebar: Contains filtering options.
SearchBar: Implements recipe search functionality.
RecipeList: Renders the list of RecipeCard components.
Header: Contains page title, navigation (if applicable), and potential user profile information.
Data Modeling: Create an array of JavaScript objects representing the sample recipes. Each object should adhere to the structure provided in the assignment description, including properties like name, chef, totalRatings, avgRating, uploadedOn, mealType, dishType, testKitchenApproved, contestWinner, featured, description, and imgUrl. Generate at least 15-20 sample recipes. Store this data in a suitable location (e.g., a separate data.js file).

Implement RecipeCard Component: Create the RecipeCard component to display the recipe information. This component should receive a single recipe object as a prop and render the corresponding details (image, name, chef, rating, etc.). Pay close attention to the UI design and use appropriate HTML elements and CSS classes to match the intended appearance.

Implement RecipeList Component: Create the RecipeList component to manage and display the list of RecipeCard components. This component should receive the array of recipe objects as a prop and map over the array to render a RecipeCard component for each recipe.

Implement Search Functionality: Create the SearchBar component. This component should contain an input field where users can enter their search queries. Implement the logic to filter the recipes based on the search terms. The search should consider the recipe name, chef name, and description. Use the useState hook to manage the search input and the useEffect hook (if needed) to update the displayed recipes.

Implement Sorting Functionality: Within the RecipeList component or a separate utility function, implement the sorting logic. Provide options to sort the recipes based on:

Upload Date (Newest & Oldest)
Average Rating (Highest & Lowest)
Use JavaScript's sort() method to sort the recipe array based on the selected criteria.

Implement Filtering Functionality: Create the FilterSidebar component to provide users with filtering options. Implement the following filters:

Attributes: Contest Winner, Featured, Test Kitchen-Approved
Meal Type: Dinner, Lunch, Dessert, Breakfast
Dish Type: Curry, Pizza, Seafood, Soup, Mexican, Smoothie
Use the useState hook to manage the filter selections. Implement the logic to filter the recipes based on the selected filters.

Implement Clear Filters Functionality: Add a "Clear All Filters" button to the FilterSidebar component. When clicked, this button should reset all filter selections and display the complete list of recipes.

Implement Individual Filter Removal: Allow users to remove individual filters separately. This can be implemented by displaying a small "x" button next to each selected filter, which, when clicked, removes that specific filter and updates the displayed recipes.

Responsiveness Implementation: Implement a responsive layout using CSS media queries or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS. Ensure that the page adapts well to different screen sizes (laptop, tablet, and mobile). For tablet and mobile, design the layout based on your understanding of UI principles and best practices.

III. Styling and Design:

UI Replication: Prioritize accurately replicating the provided UI design. Pay attention to details such as colors, fonts, spacing, and component placement.

CSS Framework/Modules: Use Tailwind CSS or standard CSS modules for styling. If using Tailwind CSS, leverage its utility classes to achieve the desired look and feel. If using CSS modules, create separate CSS files for each component and import them into the corresponding JavaScript files.

Responsiveness Design: Implement responsiveness using media queries within your CSS or by utilizing Tailwind CSS's responsive modifiers (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:, xl:).

Image Optimization: Use optimized images to improve page load times. Consider using a service like Imagekit or Cloudinary for image optimization.

IV. Deployment:

Choose a Platform: Select a suitable platform for deploying your project. Vercel and Netlify are recommended due to their ease of use and integration with GitHub.

Create an Account: Create an account on your chosen platform.

Connect to GitHub Repository: Connect your platform account to your GitHub repository containing the project code.

Configure Deployment Settings: Configure the deployment settings on the platform. This typically involves specifying the build command (npm run build or yarn build) and the publish directory (build).

Deploy the Project: Deploy the project to the platform. The platform will automatically build and deploy your application.

Environment Variables (If Necessary): If your application requires any environment variables (e.g., API keys), configure them on the deployment platform.
